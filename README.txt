Name: The Virtual Tour

Description: Participants are given access to a machine which has a virtual tour on it. 

Solution: Participants will have to discover the path to the API endpoints (Can be found using hints from inside the code.)

The endpoints are located at api/maps/(up|down|left|right) and api/maps/zoom/(in|out)

Once the competitors figure this out, they must navigate around the image quickly as it resets its location after 5 seconds. 

location is right 7, down 1, zoomed in 2
